3.  `getCast(id[,n])`: `id` refers to IMDBID like _tt1825683_, `n` is optional, it specify number of actors and actresses. By default it is set to 20. This function provide cast of the movies.
4.  `getFull(id)`: `id` refers to IMDBID like _tt1825683_. This function is the amalgamation of above three. And its configurations are set to default.
5.  For making a get request use **request**

13. `changeQuality(url,n)` a function to change the quality of image in `url` based on the scale of _0-5_ n specify the scale .

### Check test.js for example of allmost very function usage and returned data ;)

## Using above function in different PNC

If awards and cast is only required,

```javascript
const funs = [awardsPage("tt1825683"), getCast("tt1825683", 14)];
Promise.all(funs)
  .then(data => {
    return { ...data[0], ...data[1] };
  })
  .then(movieDetails => {
    console.log(movieDetails);
  });
```

### To install the package

```
npm install --save imdb-scrapper
```

## Search APIs

The most important aspect of any movie website is search. This module provides two search strategies:

1.  `search(term,n)`: `term` represents the search query and `n` signify the required number of results. The
    function provide search results from all the genres.
2.  `simpleSearch(term)`: `term` represents the search query. This function is faster as it directly uses
    the ajax calls made by IMDB page and is suited for auto complete feature.

## Trending Movies

This section is not provided by any other api or scrapper including cast and awards.
There are two different ways of scrapping provide by this lib:

1.  `getTrending([n])`: `n` is an optional parameter, representing the count of result required. This function provides
    the trending movies known as _trending 250_ on IMDB website.
2.  `getTrendingGenre(genre [,n])`: `n` is an optional parameter, representing the count of result required. This function provide results sorted on the basis of genres.
